Sherlock is a dynamic discord moderation bot.  While still in early stages of development, it is still loaded with many commonly asked features like adding roles to users or muting.  Our biggest push is to make Sherlock autonomous so there is less worry about functionality and more focus on maintaining your discord server with ease.  

I fully welcome all new ideas and feature requests however for this bot, I am trying to follow a few core values:

- Ease of Use
- Fully dynamic
- Autonomous
- Usable for any server

## Current Features  

- **User Muting** - Remove a user's ability to write messages in all channels. (Users are still able to read all messages)  
- **Channel Cooldown** - Mute a channel for a certain length of time.  This helps with a converation has become heated and just needs to be digressed.  
- **Language Filtering** - Custom triggers to warn/delete messages containing explicit content.  100% in your control of what triggers you want in your server.  
- **Timed Events (Muting/Ban)** - Automatic unban/unmute after time expiration.  Spend less time looking at the clock and more time having fun.  
- **Infraction System** - Log mod/admin notes against a user.  Wanna keep notes for troublesome users or warn other moderators/admins if a user starts causing more issues?  Give them an infraction.  This will record the note to the database.  Better watch out kids.  This is going on your pernament record!  
- **Assignable Roles** - Allows users to self assign themselves roles that are determined by you.  Give users access to any role by using a custom trigger.  
- **Embed Filtering** - Suppresses embed messages if too many embeds are detected within a certain amount of time/messages.
- **Welcome Messages** - Give members who join your server a nice hearty welcome!  

## Upcoming Features

- Raid control - Force users to accept an agreement to enter the server.
- Reporting - Allow users to report others anonmously.
- Custom message triggers
