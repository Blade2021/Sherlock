Sherlock is a dynamic discord administration bot.  While still in early stages of development, it is still loaded with many commonly asked features like adding roles to users or muting.  Our biggest push is to make Sherlock autonomous so there is less worry about functionality and more focus on maintaining your discord server with ease.   

I fully welcome all new ideas and feature requests however for this bot, I am trying to follow a few core values:

- Ease of Use
- Fully dynamic
- Autonomous
- Usable for any server
