Sherlock is a dynamic discord administration bot.  While still in early stages of development, it is still loaded with many commonly asked features like adding roles to users or muting.  Our biggest push is to make Sherlock autonomous so there is less worry about functionality and more focus on maintaining your discord server with ease.   

I fully welcome all new ideas and feature requests however for this bot, I am trying to follow a few core values:

- Ease of Use
- Fully dynamic
- Autonomous
- Usable for any server

## Current Features  

- **User Muting** - Remove a user's ability to write messages in all channels.  
- **Channel Cooldown** - Mute a channel for a certain length of time.
- **Language Filtering** - Custom triggers to warn/delete messages containing explicit content.
- **Timed Events (Muting/Ban)** - Automatic unban/unmute after time expiration.
- **Infraction System** - Log mod/admin notes against a user.
- **Assignable Roles** - Allows users to self assign themselves roles that are determined by you.
- **Embed Filtering** - Suppresses embed messages if too many embeds are detected within a certain amount of time/messages.
- **Welcome Messages** - Give members who join your server a nice hearty welcome!
- **Customizable Moderator Roles** - Give your moderators access to the commands that YOU designate.  

## Upcoming Features

- Raid control - Force users to accept an agreement to enter the server.
- Reporting - Allow users to report others anonymously.
- Custom message triggers
